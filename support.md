## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is the Daily over Decades challenge?**  
A: The Daily over Decades (DoD) challenge is a long-term fitness commitment created by [Garage Gym Athlete](https://www.garagegymathlete.com/daily-over-decades). It's designed to help you complete 200 or 300 training sessions per year, with additional requirements for weekly minutes and daily calories depending on your chosen track. The challenge emphasizes consistency and building lasting fitness habits over decades.

**Q: What challenge tracks are available?**  
A: You can choose from three tracks:

- **EPIC:** 300 sessions/year, 300 min/week, 300 cal/day, plus 300k steps/month and 300k lbs lifting volume/month
- **300:** 300 sessions/year, 300 min/week, 300 cal/day
- **200:** 200 sessions/year, 200 min/week, 200 cal/day

**Q: Can I change my challenge track after starting?**  
A: No, the track is set when you create your challenge. You can reset your challenge to start over with a different track, but this will delete all your existing data.

**Q: What happens if I miss a requirement?**  
A: The app will automatically downgrade you to the next level. For example, if you're on EPIC Level 3 and miss daily calories, you'll be downgraded to 300 Level 2. You can acknowledge the downgrade and continue tracking at the lower level.

### Apple Health Integration

**Q: How do I sync with Apple Health?**  
A: Tap the "Sync Apple Health" button on the home screen. The app will request permission to read your workout data. Once granted, workouts will automatically sync when you open the app.

**Q: Which fitness apps work with Apple Health?**  
A: Any app that syncs to Apple Health will work, including:

- Strava
- Runkeeper
- Nike Run Club
- Peloton
- Apple Watch Workouts
- And many more

**Q: Will syncing duplicate my workouts?**  
A: No, the app prevents duplicates by tracking which workouts have already been imported.

**Q: Can I revoke Apple Health access?**  
A: Yes, go to iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Health → Endurien, and toggle off the permissions you want to revoke.

### Data & Privacy

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: All data is stored locally on your device using SQLite. No data is sent to servers or cloud services.

**Q: Can I export my data?**  
A: Data export functionality is coming soon in a future update. For now, all data is stored locally on your device.

**Q: What happens if I delete the app?**  
A: All data stored locally will be permanently deleted. Data export functionality is coming soon, which will allow you to backup your data before deleting the app.

**Q: Do I need an account to use the app?**  
A: No, the app works completely offline with no login or account required.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The app won't sync with Apple Health**  
A:

1. Make sure you've granted Health permissions in iOS Settings
2. Check that you have workouts in Apple Health
3. Try tapping "Sync Apple Health" again
4. Make sure your challenge start date isn't in the future

**Q: My progress board isn't updating**  
A:

1. Make sure you've logged sessions (either manually or via Apple Health sync)
2. Check that your sessions are dated within your challenge period (365 days from start date)
3. Try closing and reopening the app

**Q: Can I log workouts from past dates?**  
A: Yes! When logging a session, tap on the date field and select any past date. This is perfect for catching up on forgotten workouts.

**Q: The app crashes when I open it**  
A:

1. Try force-closing the app and reopening
2. Make sure you're running iOS 15.1 or later
3. If the problem persists, delete and reinstall the app (you'll lose local data - data export is coming soon)

**Q: How do I reset my challenge?**  
A: Challenge reset functionality is coming soon in a future update. For now, if you need to start over, you would need to delete and reinstall the app (this will permanently delete all your data).
